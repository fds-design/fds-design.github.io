          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This is the realization design. This is the Final Sheet, and it will
            be the one that someone will implement. So it needs much more detail
            and depth, and care and attention. It will contain enough design
            information and description for someone to be able to implement it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The structure of this sheet is the same 2/3 split as the
            middle-sheets, but the main difference is that the final panel
            includes Detail (information of what to do now, or issues to
            consider, to implement the design) rather than the pro/cons panel.
          </p>

          <h2>Panels</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Layout.</strong> Same information as the middle sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus/parti panel.</strong> The short title, along with
              the summary of the essence and underpinning structure of the main
              idea.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Summary.</strong> Meta information (author, sheet, date
              etc.). along with the two or three word descriptive title, and a
              2-line description of the idea.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operations/components.</strong> Either a detailed list or
              description of the main components of the system, which are also
              labelled the same numbers as the labels in the Big Picture/Layout
              panel. Or a set of operations to describe the Action/result pairs
              for the interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Detail.</strong> Description of the next steps and how to
              make this idea a reality! The detail panel could include.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Description of what algorithms are being used (perhaps
                  citations of those algorithms or some critical maths used by
                  the algorithm)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any dependencies. E.g. this could be software libraries that
                  the tool would be built upon, or aspects such as that it must
                  be compatible with a current tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Estimates of cost or time to build, or man-months of effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Specific requirements such as details of any materials and
                  quantities required. E.g. hardware requirements, quantity of
                  pixels on a screen.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
