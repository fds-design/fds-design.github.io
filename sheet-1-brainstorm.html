          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of brainstorming is to enlarge the design space of
            possibilities. There should be a focus on quantity - to generate all
            the possible designs. This may, or may not, be a group activity.
            Brainstorming on one's own can be likewise rewarding. Also, software
            can be used to help in the process (such as the use of mind-map
            software can help users order their thoughts and ideas around a
            topic). But in this work, we advocate sketching as the principal
            design tool.
          </p>

          <h2>Panels</h2>

          <p>There are five stages (panels) in this task:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Generate Ideas.</strong> Sketch and draw as many ideas as
              you can think of. In reality these are mini ideas. They are short
              concepts that could be part of a whole. E.g. use a scatter plot,
              or line graph, or need some Dynamic query task to filter the
              results. These may be comprehensive and complete ideas, or
              half-baked ideas, simple concepts, or merely wacky suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Filter the ideas.</strong> Take the ideas and start to
              remove any duplication. Remove any ideas that seem too like
              another idea.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Categorize the sketches.</strong> Start to order and
              categorize the sketches, the mini-ideas. Concepts that are similar
              should be located together. If you are using sticky-notes then
              these can be easily moved and categorized on a wall, for instance.
              There may be different and alternative categorizations; just
              choose one and move on. The categorization and the ideas will
              probably change and develop anyhow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine & refine.</strong> Start to organize the mini
              ideas into bigger solutions. Perhaps have multiple views: this
              could be two visualizations that demonstrate different aspects of
              the same information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Question.</strong> The final stage is to question what has
              been generated. Does this provide a solution that the client
              wants? Does it answer the original research questions?
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This process can be run as a group activity. It is important to
            consider that participants must not initially criticize or evaluate
            the worth of individual designs. Keep the ideas flowing by getting
            participants to sketch their individual ideas down on their own
            sheets of paper (sticky notes are useful in this exercise). Invite
            and record any ideas that they participants create. Try to make sure
            that the whole design space of possible designs is covered. Unusual
            or wacky ideas should be tabled.
          </p>

          <h2>The process as a group participation exercise</h2>

          <p>All participants listen to the challenge/task</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Individually write down on sticky-notes their own thoughts</li>
            <li>Collate all sticky-notes (the ideas) in the group</li>
            <li>
              Stack the sticky-notes of similar ideas on top of each other
            </li>
            <li>In the group organize the sticky-notes</li>
            <li>
              Categorize the idea space by moving the stick-notes into groups of
              like-ideas
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine and refine the ideas: Use sketching and start to prepare
              the three main design-sheets
            </li>
            <li>
              Start to discuss the benefits/challenges: or
              advantages/disadvantages of the categorized ideas
            </li>
          </ol>
