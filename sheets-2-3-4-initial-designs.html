          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The three individual design sheets are to record three ideas from
            the initial brain-storming exercise. The use of the number three is
            for guidance only. But it is recommended that three design sheets
            are created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Too few designs mean that it is difficult to have a discussion with
            the client. Too many and it would waste the client's time. It may be
            that there are only two sensible designs, but it would be better to
            create a third design, however unusual or unfeasible it seems,
            because the client may be able to see or extend the ideas through
            discussion. They may be able to see an application of the idea
            further than you can.
          </p>
          <p>Keep to the 2:3 split design of the Five Design-Sheets layout.</p>
          <p>
            These design sheets should represent three completely different
            designs. Consider the hyperspace of possible designs, the three that
            you should propose should cover this design space well.
          </p>
          <h2>Panels</h2>
          <p>
            The Content of the three design sheets should all look the same,
            with the 5 parts. These are named “panels”.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Layout.</strong> Also known as the Big Picture Panel, the
              layout panel contains picutres of what the final design would look
              like. Remember you could give this design to someone else to
              create, so you are basically saying “my design will look something
              like this”. So if you are building a website of many pages, you
              will need to include several pictures to describe the main pages
              of that site. If you are designing a new mobile phone App, then
              you should have a picture of a wire-frame mobile phone, with some
              content. If you are designing a powerwall, then sketch a picture
              of the size and shape of the display along with a typical room
              that it will fill. Thus your design will be showing in the place
              of use. In this panel you are sketching a vision of what the final
              visualization would look like. Commonly this would appear as a
              sketched screenshot of the typical visualization application. You
              will also need to label the parts here. As they will need to be
              listed out under Components/Operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Focus (the Parti panel)</strong>. The idea of a parti
              comes from architecture. It is the main underpinning concept.
              Think about the main essence of your idea. In this panel you will
              need to sketch and write about the main idea. You can also think
              about the part of the idea that the user will focus and spend most
              of their time doing. If an implementer of your design, does not
              include this “thing” then your design will not be suitable for
              use. To complete this panel, start off by writing a 2- or
              three-word name of the idea - by considering a few words, or a
              name for this idea, you will be able to consider the important
              aspects of the design. But also you can use this name to reference
              back to the idea at a later stage. Then add some sketches and
              words to describe the essence. There may be a few key
              visualization techniques, or, novel visualizations that are being
              created for this tool, whatever they are, they should be described
              in the Focus/Parti section.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Components/Operations.</strong> Depending on what you are
              designing, either put a list of the component parts, or a list of
              the operations. So, if you are designing a new tiled screen, you
              could add a list a component parts. The screen itself, mounting
              structure, way to connect the HDMI ports to each screen, power
              cables and connectors, the computer requirements and way to
              connect it. If you are designing a new Application, you will have
              the several component parts, visualisations, menu items. But also,
              you will have some operations on those parts. Click here to select
              the menu, which then opens the file browser. In this case you will
              have Action/Result pairs. E.g., click to open a file browser. Add
              labels, which correspond to the Big Picture Panel, and sketches
              and some brief descriptions of how the user operates the
              visualization or controls the user interface should also be
              included.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pro/Cons and discussion.</strong> Describe the Pros and
              Cons of the technique. Be descriptive and justify ideas. Don't
              just say “it's good” say why it is good.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Summary information.</strong> In the
              summary/meta-information panel, you include the general
              information (authors, date, sheet number and task), but also a
              title of the idea, and a short 2-line description of the
              challenge. E.g., Flood Fill Explanation could be a short
              descriptive title, with a description as “Designing an explanatory
              visualisation of the Flood Fill Algorithm, that fills polygons
              with pixels”.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The three middle-design sheets aid you in your discussion with the
            client. The sketches give the appearance that the ideas could
            change. Also, the designs give the client an understanding of the
            breadth of possible outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are different approaches to designing the Big Picture and
            Parti/Focus sections of the design sheet. One method is to follow
            Dan Roam's suggestions of sketching designs that are Portrait,
            Chart, Map, Timeline, Flowchart, and plot. Each of these represent
            who/what, how much, where, when, how and why, respectively. Dan Roam
            also suggests that the designer should think whether they are simple
            vs elaborate diagrams, quantity, or quality, visionary or execution,
            individual or comparative.
